#+TITLE: Nonguix Installation Guide
#+AUTHOR: Daniel Rose

This document is a guide for installing GNU Guix using the live system
booted from a ~nonguix~ installation medium. The installation medium
is provided by a GitHub Action from System Crafters, and uses the full
Linux kernel, as opposed to the libre one. This allows for more driver
support, such as WiFi on many modern laptops, and makes the
installation process much easier.

Before installing, it would be advised to view the [[/guix/faqs][FAQs]].

For installations of software and specific issues, please search for
your topic or look in the categories.

GNU Guix should run on most x86-64 compatible PCs. As the installation
process needs to retrieve packages from a remote repository, this
guide assumes a working internet connection is available. The Nonguix
installation medium should cover WiFi issues normally present in the
Guix installer.

* Pre-installation

** Download the installation image

The installation image is kept at a repo in the System Crafters
organization. Click [[https://github.com/SystemCrafters/guix-installer/releases/latest][here]] to download the latest ISO. Burn this ISO to
an installation medium (flash drive or DVD), and boot from it. For
example, to burn it to a USB flash drive at ~/dev/sdX~, run the
following command:

#+BEGIN_SRC sh
dd if=guix-installer.iso of=/dev/sdX status=progress bs=4M
#+END_SRC

** Booting

Boot from the installation medium, select your language and country,
and select "Install using the shell based process" when
prompted. Although this makes the installation slightly more
difficult, it allows for setting up your new installation with the
full Linux kernel (necessary for the nonfree installation.)

** Keyboard Layout

The default console keymap is US. Available layouts can be listed with:

#+BEGIN_SRC sh
ls /usr/share/kbd/keymaps/**/*.map.gz
#+END_SRC

Then load your prefered layout:

For example (German language layout):

#+BEGIN_SRC sh
loadkeys de
#+END_SRC

** Connecting to the internet

If you have ethernet, simply plug in your cable and continue to the
next step. If you have WiFi, use an editor (or ~echo~) to create a new
file called ~wifi.conf~ to store the WiFi configuration. Make sure to
set ~ssid~ to the name of your WiFi network name, and ~psk~ to the
passphrase for your WiFi. You may also need to change the ~key_mgmt~
parameter depending on the type of authentication your wifi router
supports.

#+BEGIN_SRC sh
network={
  ssid="ssid-name"
  key_mgmt=WPA-PSK
  psk="unencrypted passphrase"
}
#+END_SRC

Next, run the following commands to unblock the WiFi card, determine
its device name, and connect using the device name received. In the
example, the name is ~wlp4s0~, so ~wpa_supplicant~ is passed the flag
~-i wlp4s0~. Change this accordingly:

#+BEGIN_SRC sh
rfkill unblock all
ifconfig -a
wpa_supplicant -c wifi.conf -i wlp4s0 -B
#+END_SRC

#+BEGIN_QUOTE
*NOTE:* If for any reason running =wpa_supplicant= fails, make sure to
kill any background instances of it before trying to run it again
because the old instances will block new runs from working.  This
wasted a couple hours the first time I tried installing Guix!
#+END_QUOTE

Finally, run ~dhclient~ to turn on DNS, remembering to replace
~wlp4s0~ with your device name returned from ~ifconfig -a~:

#+BEGIN_SRC sh
dhclient -v wlp4s0
#+END_SRC

** Partition the disks

When disks are detected by the system, they are assigned a block
device. To list these block devices, run ~lsblk~ or ~fdisk -l~.

For example, running ~lsblk~ on my laptop returns these results:

#+BEGIN_SRC sh
$ lsblk

NAME          MAJ:MIN RM   SIZE RO TYPE  MOUNTPOINT
sda             8:0    0 465.8G  0 disk
├─sda1          8:1    0   549M  0 part  /boot/efi
├─sda2          8:2    0 153.5G  0 part
│ └─cryptroot 253:0    0 153.5G  0 crypt /
└─sda3          8:3    0 311.7G  0 part
  └─crypthome 253:1    0 311.7G  0 crypt /home
sr0            11:0    1  1024M  0 rom
#+END_SRC

I have an encrypted root and home (if you don't know what that is,
don't worry, it just means I have to put in two passwords before I can
use my computer), so my devices might appear differently than yours,
but the rough idea is the same. You might have no partitions (the
numbered versions, such as ~/dev/sda1~) if you just wiped your drive,
or many if you are coming from a different GNU/Linux OS or Windows.

*** Encrypted

If you would like to have encrypted block devices (entire partitions),
use LUKS. If you do not want encryption, continue reading at
"Regular."

Your encrypted blocks can be all or none, however in this example only
the root will be encrypted and UEFI will be used. If unsure, look at
"Regular" and see the potential layouts (or read the linked article
for the Arch Wiki there).

| Mount point     | Partition                   | Partition type            | Suggested size              |
|-----------------+-----------------------------+---------------------------+-----------------------------|
| ~/mnt/boot/efi~ | ~/dev/efi_system_partition~ | EFI system partition      | At least 260 MiB            |
| ~[SWAP]~        | ~/dev/swap_partition~       | Linux swap                | More than 512 MiB           |
| ~/mnt~          | ~/dev/root_partition~       | Linux x86-64 root (/)     | Remainder of the device     |

#+BEGIN_SRC sh
cfdisk /dev/root_partition
#+END_SRC

Once your partitions are created, you can enable LUKS on the root
partition by running the following commands. You can change
~system-root~ to whatever you desire:

#+BEGIN_SRC sh
cryptsetup luksFormat /dev/root_partition
cryptsetup open --type luks /dev/root_partition system-root
mkfs.ext4 -L system-root /dev/mapper/system-root
mount LABEL=system-root /mnt
#+END_SRC

Finally, ensure your EFI system partition and swap are both
activated/mounted:

#+BEGIN_SRC sh
mkdir -p /mnt/boot/efi
mount /dev/efi_system_partition /mnt/boot/efi

swapon /dev/swap_partition
#+END_SRC

Proceed to "Installation."

*** Regular

If you would not like to have encrypted block devices (entire
partitions), you can partition your drives just as you would for any
other GNU/Linux OS. For example, you could have the following layout
(as suggested by the Arch Wiki) if using UEFI (most modern computers):

| Mount point     | Partition                   | Partition type            | Suggested size              |
|-----------------+-----------------------------+---------------------------+----------------------------- |
| ~/mnt/boot/efi~ | ~/dev/efi_system_partition~ | EFI system partition      | At least 260 MiB            |
| ~[SWAP]~        | ~/dev/swap_partition~       | Linux swap                | More than 512 MiB           |
| ~/mnt~          | ~/dev/root_partition~       | Linux x86-64 root (/)     | At least 1/3 of your device |
| ~/mnt/home~     | ~/dev/home_partition~       | Linux x86-64 home (/home) | Remainder of the device     |

For BIOS with MBR, the Arch Wiki suggests the following:

| Mount point | Partition             | Partition type | Suggested size              |
|-------------+-----------------------+----------------+-----------------------------|
| ~[SWAP]~    | ~/dev/swap_partition~ | Linux swap     | More than 512 MiB           |
| ~/mnt~      | ~/dev/root_partition~ | Linux          | At least 1/3 of your device |
| ~/mnt/home~ | ~/dev/home_partition~ | Linux          | Remainder of the device     |

Many other partitioning schemes exist: if you'd like to try other ones
or learn about your options, check out the Arch Wiki's page for
[[https://wiki.archlinux.org/title/Partitioning#Example_layouts][partitioning]].

Partition your disks using either ~cfdisk~ or ~fdisk~:

#+BEGIN_SRC sh
cfdisk /dev/sdX

fdisk /dev/sdX
#+END_SRC

Next, you should format your partitions with the correct file
system. To create an Ext4 file system on ~/dev/root_partition~, run:

#+BEGIN_SRC sh
mkfs.ext4 /dev/root_partition
#+END_SRC

To initialize swap, run the following command:

#+BEGIN_SRC sh
mkswap /dev/swap_partition
#+END_SRC

Now it is time to mount your partitions. This will change depending on
your chosen layout, but all drives are mounted as such:

#+BEGIN_SRC sh
mount /dev/partition_name /mnt
#+END_SRC

Replace ~partition_name~ with the partition's name, and ~/mnt~ with
the necessary location. The following locations are used:

- Root partition: ~/mnt~
- Home partition: ~/mnt/home~
- EFI system partition: ~/mnt/boot/efi~

In order to mount a partition, that directory (folder) needs to
exist. For ~/mnt/home~ and ~/mnt/boot/efi~ (if created) create the
directories as follows /after/ mounting ~/mnt~:

#+BEGIN_SRC sh
mkdir -p /mnt/boot/efi

mkdir -p /mnt/home
#+END_SRC

Swap is activated with the ~swapon~ command:

#+BEGIN_SRC sh
swapon /dev/swap_partition
#+END_SRC

* Installation

** Herd store

Once all partitions are mounted, you can begin the
installation. First, set up the installation environment using ~herd~:

#+BEGIN_SRC sh
herd start cow-store /mnt
#+END_SRC

** System configuration

The following steps will change depending on your approach. If you've
used Guix in the past and would like to use your dotfiles and system
configuration (your custom configurations), clone your repository now.

If you would like to make your own, you need to at least have the
nonguix channels setup for the installation medium. If you aren't sure
what that means, or how to do that yourself, follow the instructions
below for now, only copying the ~channels.scm~.

If you do not have personal dotfiles yet, and would like to try David
Wilson's, clone the following repository using ~git~ into your current
directory (i.e. not ~/mnt~):

#+BEGIN_SRC sh
git clone https://github.com/daviwil/dotfiles
#+END_SRC

** Channels

Regardless of your path, you should now add the nonguix and necessary
custom channels to the installation medium. Run the following commands
to set up the necessary channels and run ~guix pull~ (equivalent to
~apt update~, updates the files available without updating the ones on
the system):

#+BEGIN_SRC sh
mkdir -p ~/.config/guix
# If you cloned David Wilson's dotfiles:
cp dotfiles/guix/channels.scm ~/.config/guix
# Otherwise, add the channels.scm file yourself and edit it with nonguix and your necessary channels
guix pull
# This is necessary to ensure the updated profile path is active!
hash guix
#+END_SRC

The pull operation can take quite a while, depending upon your machine
and the last time the nonguix installation ISO was updated. I'd
recommend getting a cup of coffee (or tea, or whatever your preferred
beverage is!)

** Update system configuration

Once the operation is finished, you will need to update your
configuration to point to your partition UUIDs and labels for the
system that you are installing. In order to get your UUIDs, run the
following command:

#+BEGIN_SRC sh
blkid
#+END_SRC

This will return a long list of IDs that you can write down, take a
picture of, ~cat~ or ~echo~ into your configuration, depending on
which is more comfortable to you (if you're not too familiar with
GNU/Linux, I'd recommend writing the IDs down. They are long, but it
is faster and safer in the long run.) You can also switch to another
TTY using ~Ctrl-Alt-F#~ and press ~Enter~ or ~Return~ to get to
another root prompt. You can then switch back and forth between the
previous TTY on ~F3~ instead of writing down your IDs.

If you have encrypted partitions, yyou can use the following command
to find the UUID:

#+BEGIN_SRC sh
cryptsetup luksUUID /dev/root_partition
#+END_SRC

** Initialize system

Finally, we can initialize the system by running the following command:

#+BEGIN_SRC sh
# Change the .dotfiles directory to your dotfiles if necessary
guix system -L ~/.dotfiles/.config/guix/systems init path/to/config.scm /mnt
#+END_SRC

This can take a /very/ long time depending on your internet connection
and computer. If using a laptop, please ensure it is plugged in. If
any errors occur during the installation, simply resume the
installation as the Guix store has the previous packages saved. If the
error continues, consider contacting someone at the System Crafters'
Discord, IRC, or Matrix "Links?" <placeholder>.

* Post-installation

** User accounts

Congratulations! Your GNU Guix System installation is (almost)
complete. Reboot your system, take out your installation medium, and
login as root when you are faced with a login prompt. Your last
crucial step is to add a password for your accounts. Once logged in,
run the following commands:

#+BEGIN_SRC sh
# Set the password for your root account
passwd
# Set the password for your user
passwd <your username>
#+END_SRC

Log out, and log into your user account.

** Dotfiles

Clone your dotfiles repository (or David Wilson's again) and ensure
that the channels include nonguix. If using David Wilson's dotfiles,
~cd~ into the directory and run:

#+BEGIN_SRC sh
stow .
#+END_SRC

If using your own dotfiles, you know how to deploy them. If you don't
have a good way to deploy your dotfiles yet, consider using ~stow~
"Link?" <placeholder>.

** Channels

Verify that your ~channels.scm~ file is in the target path
(~\~/.config/guix~) and then run the following to update your
channels:

#+BEGIN_SRC sh
guix pull
#+END_SRC

** General recommendations

You can now install whatever packages or manifests you need and
have. If you are new to GNU Guix, continue reading at the "Basics of
GNU GUIX" page <placeholder>. If interested in basic system setups and
advice, continue reading at [[/guix/general-recommendations][general recommendations]]. Otherwise, once
again, congratulations!  You have officially installed a
nonfree/nonguix Guix System!
